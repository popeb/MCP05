###DefineRDBs.R
    DefineRDBs( x, Slope_E = 2.75e-6, Slope_L = 1e-06, Ends = 1e6, Data_Points = 30
                Length_Max = 1e6, Length_Min = 2e5, RTU_Min = 0.55, Span = 35,
                Gap = 8e4, Gap_Dis = 125e3 )

DefineRDBs is designed to identify slope transitions along chromosomal profiles of DNA replication timing data but can be applied in principle to any bivariate data.

#####Input
x  -  table with columns "CHR" and "POSITION" indicating genomic coordinates of data points and at least one additional column containing replication timing data for each individual sample

#####Parameters
Slope_E  -  slope threshold for early Timing Transition Region (TTR) borders

Slope_L  -  slope threshold for late TTR borders

Ends  -  minimum distance between early TTR borders and chromosome ends

Data_Points  -  minimum number of data points within TTRs

Length_Max  -  maximum TTR size

Length_Min  -  minimum TTR size

RTU_Min  -  minimum replication timing difference across TTR

Span  -  span for loess smoothing

Gap  -  threshold to define gaps in data point spacing

Gap_Dis  -  minimum distance between early TTR borders and gaps in data point spacing
